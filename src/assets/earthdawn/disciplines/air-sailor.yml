description:
  Air Sailors are the swashbuckling brotherhood of the sky. Air Sailors never
  leave their fellows behind and embrace the idea of togetherness, working to
  protect and spread civilization, rather than preying upon it.

karmaRitual:
  The Air Sailor sits alone in silent meditation under the open sky for several
  minutes, picturing in his mind’s eye his airship sailing through the clouds at
  the start of a long journey. The adept envisions an aerial journey he hopes to
  make one day, imagining scenes of this journey, including the risks and
  perils, and how his training and skills might help make the journey a safe
  one. The ritual is complete when, half an hour later, the imagined journey
  ends safely.

  recognition of different types of airships, commonly followed flight paths,
