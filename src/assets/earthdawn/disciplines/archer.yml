description:
  The Archer learns the art of the bow and crossbow, and by extension, all types
  of ranged attacks. This Discipline stresses accuracy and speed. Most Archers
  show greatly enhanced perceptive powers, frequently noticing things that
  others miss.

karmaRitual:
  The Archer spends a few minutes oiling and stringing his bow, then starts
  meditating, with the bow in front of him and his arrows fanned out beside him
  on the ground. As he meditates, he seeks the stillness before the arrow is
  released from the string. The Archer then fires three arrows at a target,
  forming a rough triangle no more than a foot wide, then fires a fourth arrow
  into the center of the triangle. The ritual is complete when the last arrow
  hits.

artisanSkills:
  - Arrow Fletching
  - Wood Carving

halfMagic:
  Archers may use half-magic when caring for ranged weapons and to recognize
  different types of ranged weapons, ammunition, or their creators.
