description:
  "Beastmasters are adepts that use magic to emulate and interact with animals
  and other creatures. Some develop these abilities to become expert trackers
  and survivalists, while others forge magical bonds with animal companions, or
  train and care for the domestic animals that support day to day life in
  Barsaive.

  Note: Many of the Beastmaster’s talents and abilities refer to Animal
  Companions. An animal may be considered an Animal Companion if it has a Loyal
  attitude towards the Beastmaster. See the Animal Bond talent on p. 125 for
  details."

karmaRitual:
  The Beastmaster walks off a large circle around the area on which he last
  slept. Then he sits in the center of the circle and makes a silent, meditative
  call to the animals of the area. At the end of the half-hour-long ritual, an
  animal typical of the local wildlife approaches, but does not enter, the
  circle. The adept motions for the animal to enter the circle, thus completing
  the ritual. The animal then leaves the circle and departs.
