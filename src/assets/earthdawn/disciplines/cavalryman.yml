description:
  "Members of the Cavalryman Discipline are fierce, mounted warriors. They train
  with their mounts and form a close empathic bond with them. A Cavalryman
  typically respects his mount more than any Namegiver, with the possible
  exception of other Cavalrymen. This Discipline emphasizes motion and empathy
  for one’s mount.

  Mount: Cavalrymen begin the game with a mount of the gamemaster’s approval
  (see p. 431 for a selection). The mount is trained for riding only; the
  Cavalryman needs to combat-train it (p. 395). Humans, orks, and elves prefer
  horses, although many tribal ork Cavalrymen use thundra beasts. Trolls,
  windlings and dwarfs find horses awkward to ride. Some dwarf Cavalrymen ride
  ponies due to their short size; some use the troajin or the huttawa. Because
  of their size and weight, troll Cavalrymen are known to ride large war horses,
  but most ride an unusually strong and sturdy breed of horse called a granlain.
  Too small to ride normal horses, windling Cavalrymen most often ride small
  lizard-like mounts known as kues, or large birds called zoaks."

karmaRitual:
  The Cavalryman plants a target in the ground, then rides his mount several
  minutes distance away. Blindfolding himself, he directs his mount to return to
  the target. Once he closes to about 100 yards, the Cavalryman uses the almost
  psychic connection with his mount, and whatever other empathic talents he
  possesses, to urge his mount to charge the target. Still blindfolded, the
  Cavalryman strikes the target with one of his weapons. He then removes the
  blindfold to end the ritual.

halfMagic:

          Training, and Blood Share would get the bonus, but Trick Riding in
