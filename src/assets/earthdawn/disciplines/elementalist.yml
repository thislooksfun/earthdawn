description:
  "An Elementalist is a magician who focuses on learning about, and gaining power
  over, the five magical elements: air, earth, fire, water, and wood."

karmaRitual:
  The Elementalist draws a large triangle on the ground. The Elementalist sits
  in the triangle and boils a pot of water, singing to the fire to encourage its
  heat. Then the Elementalist extinguishes the fire and adds earth to the water,
  turning it into hot mud. After letting it cool for a few minutes, the
  Elementalist covers his face with the mud like war paint, and sings to the
  wind, calling a small breeze. As the wind dries the mud, much of it cracks
  and blows away, leaving behind a series of intricate, swirling patterns. The
  Karma ritual is then complete.

artisanSkills:
  - Robe Embroidery
  - Sculpting

halfMagic:
  Elementalists use half-magic for knowledge of nature, the elements, uses of
  elemental magic, and other magical rituals. The Elementalist may make a
  Perception-based Half-Magic test to detect the presence of elemental spirits
  within 30 yards. The Difficulty Number for sensing an elemental spirit is the
  spirit’s Mystic Defense. If the test succeeds, the character can sense the
  presence of the elemental spirit and can use spells, or talents such as
  Elemental Tongues and Elemental Hold, to communicate and interact with it.
  The gamemaster may choose to make this Half-Magic Test on behalf of an
  Elementalist character at any time, as this innate sense is always active.

          action with a successful Elementalism Test against the higher of the
          target’s Mystic Defense or a Difficulty Number of 6:

          1. Create a small flame between his thumb and forefinger. This fire
          lasts for only one round, but is intense enough to light a torch.
          If used in combat, it inflicts Step 4/ D6 fire damage (Physical
          Armor provides protection).

          2. Freeze water by touching it with his middle three fingers. The
          adept can freeze up to one quart of water from each use of this
          ability. If used in combat, it inflicts Step 4/D6 cold damage
          (Physical Armor provides protection)."
