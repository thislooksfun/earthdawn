description: Illusionists cast spells that work through deception. However, some
  Illusionist spells do have real effects; Illusionists learned long ago that if
  everything they did was an illusion, people quickly caught on and their magic
  became less effective. Now they balance real magic, illusions, trickery, and
  sleight of hand.

karmaRitual:
  "The Illusionist does not use the same ritual each time. His Karma ritual does
  require him to incorporate certain elements every time, however: showy spells,
  tricks or snappy banter, and an assistant. Other than that, the Illusionist
  makes up his ritual on the spot. The Illusionist must do his best during this
  time to convince his assistant that the ritual is very serious and must
  conform to a precise formula."

artisanSkills:
  - Acting
  - Robe Embroidery

halfMagic:
  Illusionists make Half-Magic tests to recognize different types of magic use,
  as well as specific uses of illusion magic. They also make Half-Magic tests
  when attempting to perceive the “truth” of a given situation.
