description: Nethermancers are spellcasters who specialize in the magic of the
  netherworlds. Their interests focus on other planes, and the spirits and
  creatures that inhabit those planes. Most people consider Nethermancers to be
  a little “off” in an eerie sort of way, and consequently followers of this
  Discipline are unlikely to win many popularity contests.

karmaRitual:
  The Nethermancer drinks tea with a spirit servant or other otherworldly
  creature and talks of life beyond this world. The ritual ends after a half
  hour has passed with the Nethermancer draining the last drop from his final
  cup of tea.

artisanSkills:
  - Bone Carving
  - Robe Embroidery

halfMagic: Nethermancers use half-magic to recognize uses of nethermantic magic,
  different types of undead and spirits, and magical rituals—especially blood
  magic rituals. Nethermancers may also use half-magic to understand the effects
  of different blood charms, as these are linked with Nethermancy. A
  Nethermancer may use half-magic to sense the presence of spirits within 30
  yards of his location. The Detection Difficulty for sensing a spirit is the
  spirit’s Mystic Defense (determined by the gamemaster). If the test succeeds,
  the Nethermancer can sense the presence of the spirit and use spells, or
  talents such as Spirit Hold or Spirit Talk, to communicate and interact with
  the spirit. The gamemaster may choose to make this Half-Magic test on behalf
  of a Nethermancer character at any time, as this innate sense is always
  active.
