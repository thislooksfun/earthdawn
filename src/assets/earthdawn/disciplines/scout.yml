description:
  Scouts are the vanguard, the tracker, and the brave rangers who go where
  others cannot. Scouts are masters of becoming one with their
  environmentâ€”whether that environment is a primeval forest or the heart of the
  city.

karmaRitual:
  The Scout allows his companions to lead him blindfolded, about ten minutes
  walk from his starting point. The Scout meditates for ten minutes as he
  visualizes the route back to where he began, then makes the journey, still
  blindfolded, to his starting point. Removing the blindfold, the half-hour-long
  ritual is complete.

artisanSkills:
  - Rune Carving
  - Wood Carving

halfMagic:
  A Scout may use half-magic to recognize tracks and trails left by different
  types of animals and Namegivers, know about the plants and creatures native to
  a region, even general information on the different cultures across Barsaive.
