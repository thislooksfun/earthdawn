description:
  Sky Raiders are ruthless pirates forming a potent force in Barsaive. Their
  airships raid all over the province, targeting merchant caravans as well as
  smaller towns and villages. Sky Raiders are proud, and show great loyalty to
  other Sky Raiders—unless that raider belongs to an enemy clan or moot.

karmaRitual:
  The Sky Raider spends several minutes in silent meditation beneath the open
  sky. Then he begins to strike his shield with a weapon, slowly at first. The
  striking accelerates until the Sky Raider is beating his shield at a furious
  rate. Just before the ritual ends, the Sky Raider stops, continuing to
  meditate while his shield still resonates from the furious bashing. The ritual
  ends when the echoes from the last drumbeat fade.

artisanSkills:
  - Painting
  - Wood Carving

halfMagic:
  Sky Raiders use half-magic for tasks related to the upkeep, repair, and
  building of smaller airships (like the drakkar), knowledge of different
  airship designs and crew complements, as well as knowledge of commonly
  followed flight paths.
