        description:
          As a Simple Action, the adept takes 2 Strain, and makes a Weapon
          Weaving test against an opponent’s Mystic Defense. If successful, he
          may ask one specific question about one of that opponent’s traits.
          This ability works like the Creature Analysis talent (p. 136), but
          only against Name-giver targets, and only allows one question.
