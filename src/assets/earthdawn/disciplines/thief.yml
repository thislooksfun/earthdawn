description:
  Thieves learn early to be self-reliant and how to steal. They draw power from
  their self-confidence and the knowledge that they depend only on themselves.
  The abundance of rumors governing Thief guilds means such groups may, in fact,
  exist, but proof or disproof of their reality remains a secret.

karmaRitual:
  The Thief sits by himself in a darkened area and concentrates for half an hour
  on the knowledge that he is alone in the world and can rely, first and
  foremost, only on himself. With this firmly established in both heart and
  mind, he sets out to use one of his Discipline talents. The ritual ends as
  soon as the adept successfully uses the talent.

artisanSkills:
  - Acting
  - Poetry

halfMagic:
  Thieves may use half-magic to build or bypass security measures intended to
  prevent theft, and to recognize different types of locking mechanisms.
