description:
  Warriors are fighters and soldiers trained to use magic to enhance their
  combat techniques. They often form groups with other Warriors, living in
  seclusion in self-sufficient settlements similar to monastic orders.

karmaRitual:
  "The Warrior sits cross-legged, holding a weapon across his knees. After a
  few minutes of meditation he levitates, as if using the Air Dance talent; the
  ritual use of this talent does not cause him any Strain damage. The Warrior
  then performs a series of four exercises: the earth defense, the water
  defense, the fire attack, and the air attack. The ritual ends when the Warrior
  completes the final move of the air attack."

artisanSkills:
  - Sculpting
  - Rune Carving

halfMagic:
  Warriors can use half-magic when caring for or repairing their weapons and
  armor, knowledge of military tactics and strategy (recognizing the safest
  approach to a target when planning a battle, for instance) and to recall
  events of Barsaiveâ€™s military history. They also use half-magic to recognize
  warrior orders, famous ancient Warriors, and ancient arms and armor.

        description:
          The adept spends 30 minutes in meditation and selects a talent. During
          any encounter over the next 24 hours, the adept may activate Battle
          Rites by spending a Karma Point as a Simple action. This allows the
          adept to reduce the Strain cost of the selected talent by 1 once per
          round for the duration of the encounter. Battle Rites may be used in
          multiple encounters, but requires a Karma Point be spent for each
          encounter.
