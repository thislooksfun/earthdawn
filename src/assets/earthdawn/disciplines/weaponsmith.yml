description:
  A Weaponsmith trains to gain an iron will and a highly critical eye. In
  addition to their role as craftsmen that make mundane weapons, armor, and
  other goods, Weaponsmiths help identify and create legendary weapons. Nearly
  every community places great value on their Weaponsmiths.

karmaRitual:
  The Weaponsmith heats a thin strip of metal in a hot fire or forge. Over the
  next half hour, he fashions the metal into a blade, arrowhead, or spear-tip,
  but instead of forging an effective item, he intentionally tempers the metal
  too soon, making it brittle. The Weaponsmith then shatters the defective piece
  of metalwork, ending the ritual.

artisanSkills:
  - Rune Carving
  - Wood Carving

halfMagic:
  Weaponsmiths may use half-magic when caring for weapons and armor and to
  recognize different types of weapons and armor used or worn by different
  Namegiver races or their creators.

        description:
          For 2 Strain, the adept uses magic to create an improvised forge,
          provided he has the minimum requirements necessary, such as a fire for
          working metal. The smithy lasts for one day, and gives a -3 penalty to
          any tests made that use it. Only the Weaponsmith may use the forge for
          tests.
