description:
  Wizards are spellcasters focusing on the theoretical aspects of magic. Those
  who follow other spellcasting Disciplines sometimes disparage Wizards as being
  “book magicians,” but it is interesting to note that very few have the guts to
  call a Wizard that to his face.

karmaRitual:
  The Wizard draws a circle at least two yards in diameter, then inscribes a
  triangle within the circle. Making any corrections necessary for accuracy in
  drawing the first circle, the Wizard draws another circle inside the triangle.
  Then a triangle within that circle, and so on. Soon the Wizard will be forced
  to create figures smaller than hand and stylus can possibly draw. He uses the
  power of magic to continue to draw, even when the results become too small to
  be seen with the naked eye. The sequence ends with a triangle and is complete
  once this final triangle is drawn.

artisanSkills:
  - Manuscript Illumination
  - Robe Embroidery

halfMagic:
  Wizards may use half-magic to recognize different types of magic use, identify
  specific uses of Wizardry, and for knowledge of magical rituals.
