  Heat Sight:
    description:
      Characters with Heat Sight can see heat radiated by another character or
      object, which translates into different colors. The colors depend on the
      relative heat given out by an object. The hottest objects show up as
      white, with the spectrum dropping through red, orange, yellow, green,
      blue, and down into violet or even black for the coldest objects.

      Heat Sight tends to fade into the background the more light is present,
      but it allows the character to see in the dark, at the expense of detail.

      Magical effects that limit normal sight, for example magical darkness,
      also affect Heat Sight, and Heat Sight does not penetrate objects.

quote:
  text: Our trade caravans travel the land, carrying our goods to the elves,
    humans, t’skrang, and even the orks. Those same caravans bring their riches
    home to us. But just because we trade with the other races, it doesn’t mean
    we want them living next door.

description:
  Dwarfs are short and stocky, averaging just over four feet in height, and
  weighing about 120 pounds. Their hair is thick and abundant, especially the
  hair on their heads, and male dwarfs commonly grow long beards, well-groomed
  and sometimes braided into elaborate patterns. Their skin tones range from
  pale pinkish-white to dark ebony, largely divided along tribal lines.

  Dwarfs are broad-chested, tough, and strong for their size. Their short legs
  are ill-suited to running, and also make it difficult for them to swim or ride
  horses. As a result, dwarfs prefer riding in carts, using ponies, or other
  animals better suited to their propor- tions. Their ears are gently pointed,
  less so than elves and windlings. Dwarfs reach physical maturity in their late
  teens, and tend to live for about 100 years.

  Dwarfs have an affinity for the earth, feeling a kinship with stone and metal.
  This, coupled with a strong inclination for organization and attention to
  detail, makes them a race of builders and craftsmen. Indeed, this tendency is
  what led the Therans to appoint the dwarfs of Throal as the province’s
  administrators before the Scourge, and helped Throal become the dominant power
  in Barsaive in the decades after the Scourge.

  A dwarf’s first loyalty is to their family and tribe, but they easily transfer
  that loyalty to their home town, city, or kingdom. Dwarfs prefer to live close
  to, or even under, the earth, with multiple generations of extended family
  under the same roof.

  While loyal and efficient, dwarfs can be quick to latch onto a single solution
  and stubbornly resist change. Dwarfs frequently come across as curt or lacking
  in social graces, but at the same time they can be friendly and open to those
  they consider friends. There is nothing a dwarf likes more than talking about
  his craft to those who show an interest—much to the chagrin of those who don’t
  care to explore a subject in exhaustive detail.
