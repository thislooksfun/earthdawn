    description:
      "Human adepts have a special racial talent available to them from First
      Circle: Versatility. This talent al- lows them to learn talents from
      Disciplines other than their own (see the Talents chapter, p. 118, for a
      full description).

      Human adepts starting play with no Ranks assigned to their Versatility
      talent know it at Rank 0. They may purchase ranks for it during the game
      using Legend Points, just like other talents, treating it as a Novice
      talent. Non-adept humans cannot learn the Versatility talent."

quote:
  text: We may not be as strong as the trolls, or as swift as the elves. We do
    not have the numbers of the orks, or the kingdoms of the dwarfs. What we
    lack in those areas, we make up for in adaptability. While we may sometimes
    be overlooked, Barsaive would not be where it is without us. We fill in the
    gaps left by the other races, the grease that keeps the wheel of
    civilization turning.

description:
  Humans average between five and a half and six feet tall, and weigh 160
  pounds. They produce less body hair than most other races except elves. Skin
  tone ranges from pinkish-white to tan and dark chocolate. Their ears are small
  and rounded. Humans reach physical maturity in their teens, and tend to live
  about seventy-five years, though some can live up to a century.

  Humans are scattered across the land, living alongside the other races of
  Barsaive. They are seldom the largest racial group in a town or city, but they
  are found almost everywhere. In many communities, they take on the roles other
  races are not as suited to. The only consistent thing that can be said about
  humans is that they can be found just about anywhere, doing just about
  anything.

  Humans feel a natural loyalty to their family, but easily trans- fer that
  loyalty to larger social groups like cities and kingdoms. However, they do not
  have the same tendency to organize that dwarfs do, so large, dedicated human
  communities remain rare. This doesnâ€™t prevent humans from rising to
  influential positions in other places, but humans in pres- ent-day Barsaive
  sometimes seem to be happiest when they can fill in where they are needed.
