      Obsidimen have very tough skin, which serves them as armor. Obsidiman skin
      has a Physical Armor Rating of 3. However, obsidimen can only wear other
      types of living armor, which add their protection to the character’s
      Natural Armor. (See Armor and Shields, p. 411; types of armor considered
      “living” are indicated as such in the armor’s description.)

  text:
    We are born of the bones of the earth. Remember, as you travel among the
    other races, that their time is but a breath of wind. They are a flame that
    burns brightly and is gone. You must watch and remember, so that the other
    children of the earth are not forgotten.
  by: Elder Yantar of the Cliffside Brotherhood

description: 
  "Obsidimen are tall, averaging around seven feet, but their massive build
  makes them appear squat from a distance. Obsidimen weigh an average of 900
  pounds, and their craggy skin and body tissue incorporate many of the
  properties of stone. Despite this rocky appearance, obsidimen are flesh and
  blood, and need food, water, and air to survive just as any other Namegiver.
  
  Obsidimen are sexless, born fully-grown from a Liferock: large stone
  formations naturally imbued with powerful elemental magic. These formations
  are rare, and usu- ally found in wild or remote areas. Obsidimen from the same
  Liferock call themselves a brotherhood, and the skin colors of a brotherhood
  commonly resemble the domi- nant stone of the area, with some individuals
  showing metallic highlights or veins of semi-precious gems.
  
  Their blood, unlike the other races, is bluish-grey. They have no body hair,
  and their ears are internal, covered over by a thin flap of skin.
  
  Obsidimen spend the first century of their life attached to their Liferock.
  During this time, the obsidiman communes with the spirits of other obsidimen
  in a state called the Dreaming. After this time, they emerge with a Name, and
  are free to travel as they wish.
  
  The natural lifespan of an obsidiman is measured in centuries, with
  individuals commonly reaching 900 years or more.
  
  Obsidimen tend to be slow and deliberate as befits their size, and the
  hastiness of the other races often mystifies and unsettles them. Their primary
  loyalty is to their brotherhood, and obsidimen do not form larger communities.
  
  Much like the stones they resemble, they are steady and patient, but when
  angered they are as implacable as an avalanche."
