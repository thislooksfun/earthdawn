  Gahad:
    description:
      Gahad is largely a roleplaying concept, best described as a physical
      sensation similar to intense heartburn.

      It is triggered by certain circumstances or situations, causing orks to
      feel a drive to eradicate the situation triggering the gahad or take
      revenge on the perpetrator. Each ork experiences gahad in response to
      unique circumstances or stimuli, and different orks feel this impulse to
      greater or lesser degrees.

      For groups that want to use some game rules to enforce gahad, they should
      describe a couple of impulses that always trigger gahad, using short sentences.

      For example, a player might specify that “Grisalk’s gahad is triggered
      when his mother is insulted.” The player may specify limits or exceptions
      for these triggers, for example that “Grisalk’s gahad is triggered when
      his mother is insulted, except by someone in the family.”

      When his gahad is triggered, the player may choose to have his character
      give in to it or try to resist the impulse. To resist gahad, the character
      has to succeed at a Willpower (6) Test, requiring a success level based on
      how severe the trigger is. In the above example, an ambiguous comment
      about Grisalk’s mother may only require a single success, while an obvious
      and vicious obscenity could require three (or more) successes.

      Successfully resisting, or “swallowing”, gahad causes a gahad hangover.
      The hangover begins within an hour of swallowing gahad and lasts for one
      hour per success required on the original Willpower Test. The hangover
      manifests as localized pains and cramps, headaches, and in extreme cases,
      hallucinations about the object of the trigger. While it lasts, the
      character is considered Harried (p. 388).

      When giving in to gahad (or if the attempt to resist it fails), the
      character is driven to end the stimuli that triggered gahad, or take
      revenge on a character that caused it. In the above example, Grisalk would
      react violently towards the person who insulted his mother or, if the
      insult consisted of an obscene picture drawn on a wall, he would destroy
      the picture. This drive lasts for as long as the hangover would have
      lasted, regardless of whether or not a resistance test was attempted. The
      character gets a +1 bonus to any Action or Effect test made towards ending
      the stimulus or taking revenge, for example to attack the insulting party
      or tear down the wall.

      Gahad is not intended to be a game mechanic giving orks a test bonus on
      every flimsy excuse. The use and application of gahad, and the bonuses or
      penalties it confers, are always at the discretion of the gamemaster. In
      addition, violent reactions, while common, are not a requirement to a
      triggered gahad—any kind of forceful, decisive action could satisfy the
      urge to act.

  Low-Light Vision:
    description:
      Low-Light Vision allows a character to see at much lower light levels than
      humans. For a character with Low-Light Vision, a single torch easily
      illuminates a 30-yard by 30-yard meeting hall.

      Starlight provides plenty of light on a clear night, and even on a night
      shrouded by thick cloud cover the character can see as well as a human
      sees at dusk. Characters with Low-Light Vision are no more susceptible to
      flash-blindness than humans. Complete darkness—the complete absence of
      light—will render a character with Low-Light Vision unable to see, like
      other characters requiring normal vision.

  text: Much of our history and culture has been forgotten, swallowed by the
    jungle and lost to the Scourge. Today we are free, but we must never forget
    where we came from, and why we fight.

description:
  Orks are tall and powerfully built, averaging about six feet in height and
  weighing over 200 pounds. They are more muscular than humans, and two large
  lower canines protrude from their mouth and cover their upper lip. Their body
  hair is coarse, and facial and head hair is frequently the texture of fine
  wire. Skin color ranges from beige to olive green, with tan, pinkish-white, or
  ebony possible, but less common.

  Orks are impulsive and their emotions burn swift and hot, a trait they call
  gahad. They anger quickly, and are just as quick to form friendships. When an
  ork is driven to act, they act, and some individuals report physical
  discomfort when they “swallow their gahad.” While this tendency can cause
  problems for their companions, orks generally consider gahad as a positive
  thing, a spiritual fire pushing them forward.

  With a lifespan averaging only 40 years, orks tend to seize life by the throat
  and get the most out of it they can. Given their emotional and impulsive
  natures, ork families tend to be sprawling affairs of half-siblings, aunts,
  uncles and cousins.

  The most common social group is a tribe or clan, living a nomadic existence on
  the plains of Barsaive. Even the reborn kingdom of Cara Fahd is not much more
  than an affiliation of multiple tribes and clans. Still, the orks are taking
  to nation-building as fiercely as anything else they attempt.

  While all the races have faced the prospect of slavery at the hands of the
  Theran Empire, the orks have a longer and deeper history with the institution.
  Ork legends tell that at one time, they were all slaves until they won their
  freedom centuries before the Scourge. As a result of this cultural legacy,
  many orks believe freedom to be one of the highest ideals in existence.
