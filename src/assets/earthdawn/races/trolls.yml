  Heat Sight:
    description:
      Characters with Heat Sight can see heat radiated by another character or
      object, which translates into different colors. The colors depend on the
      relative heat given out by an object. The hottest objects show up as
      white, with the spectrum dropping through red, orange, yellow, green,
      blue, and down into violet or even black for the coldest objects.

      Heat Sight tends to fade into the background the more light is present,
      but it allows the character to see in the dark, at the expense of detail.

      Magical effects that limit normal sight, for example magical darkness,
      also affect Heat Sight, and Heat Sight does not penetrate objects.

quote:
  text: Honor is the blood and bone of our people. The other races may use the
    word, but do not understand it as we do. Our highland cousins forget this,
    and their anger lessens us all. Act with honor in all things. Respect those
    who do the same, and remember those who do not.

description:
  "Trolls are massive, standing eight and a half feet tall and weighing 500
  pounds or more on average. Many trolls sport pronounced lower canines similar
  to orks. Skin color ranges from beige to olive and dark brown, and their skin
  has a rough texture with minor ridges and plating made of trolthelia, a
  material similar to rhinoceros horn or deer antler. Trolthelia is also the
  material that makes up a troll’s most prominent physical feature, the horns
  that grow from their heads. These horns grow slowly throughout a troll’s life,
  frequently into asymmetrical shapes.

  Some isolated clans have practices that shape their horns, while others may
  inscribe runic designs into them.

  Strong and tough, trolls reach maturity in their early teens and live into
  their fifties. They live primarily in the mountain- ous regions of Barsaive,
  and due to their size and weight find it difficult to live among the other
  races. They frequently feel a kinship with obsidimen, who they call “rock
  brothers”, and find their serenity deeply moving.

  Trolls are fiercely loyal to their families, and organize themselves into
  clans and moots—an alliance of several clans.

  The largest population of trolls in Barsaive—the Crystal Raiders of the
  Twilight Peaks—are known for their airships, which they use to raid lowland
  settlements and caravans, carrying the spoils back to their mountain homes.
  The clans of the Twilight Peaks are believed to have been the originators of
  the Sky Raider Discipline, and trolls are the most common race to practice
  that Discipline to this day.

  Trolls place great value on honor, following complex rules and guidelines for
  personal behavior that frequently baffle other races. There are three main
  concepts in troll honor: katorr, kat’ral, and katera, loosely translated as
  personal, clan, and racial honor. Individual trolls define these values in
  different ways and to varying degrees, and a troll that lives among other
  Namegivers is less likely to react violently to an insult than a Crystal
  Raider, but a troll will defend his honor if he believes it has been slighted.
  Highland trolls guilty of crimes against honor will sometimes have their horns
  cut off, marking them as kava, or “mud people”, and exiled from troll society.
  Some trolls voluntarily undergo this punishment as a way of maintaining
  personal honor, and take pride in their status as outcasts."
