    # BODY: This racial ability allows windlings to learn the talent Astral
    # BODY: Sight at rank 0. This talent should be added to the "talents"
    # BODY: section. In order to do so, however, the most rebust way would be to
    # BODY: make it an effect that adds a talent.

      All windlings have access to the Astral Sight Talent (see p. 129).
      Windling adepts starting play with no Ranks assigned to their Astral Sight
      talent know it at Rank 0. They may purchase Ranks for the talent during
      the game using Legend Points, just like other talents, treating it as a
      Novice talent.

    description:
      "Windlings can fly, but it is not their primary method of movement. Flying
      tires them quickly and windlings usually limit their flights to short
      periods of around fifteen to twenty minutes. When flying for extended
      periods of time, a windling may suffer Strain. After 20 minutes in flight
      a windling must make a Toughness (5) test. Failure means the character
      takes 1 Strain. Each five-minute period spent flying beyond the additional
      twenty minutes requires an additional Toughness test with a cumulative +2
      modifier.

      Brief interruptions do not reset the time spent flying, it reduces it on a
      one-to-one basis: a windling who has spent twenty minutes in flight and
      then rests five minutes can only fly for five more minutes before having
      to make Toughness Tests again.

      Though windling wings are durable, they become heavy and fragile when wet,
      severely impairing the windling’s ability to fly. When soaked with water,
      like falling into a stream or in heavy rain, their flight duration is
      reduced from twenty minutes to five, and the Difficulty Number of the
      Toughness tests increases by +2 every minute, instead of every five. When
      flying with wet wings, the windling is considered Harried (see p. 388).
      Windling wings dry within ten minutes of being in a dry place, or within
      five minutes of being in a warm place, such as in front of a fire."

    Do not mistake size of body for size of heart. We may be small in stature,

description:
  "Windlings are small winged Namegivers, standing around 18 inches tall and
  weighing about 13 pounds. Windlings have paired wings similar to a dragonfly,
  and can fly for limited stretches at a time. A windling’s skin and hair color
  match the brightest-colored features of their home environment: the icy white
  of a snowy mountain, the red and yellow of wildflowers, even the glazed blue
  of city roof tiles. After a windling has lived in the same place for three or
  four months, their skin color will change to match their new home.

  They have almost no body hair, but the hair on their heads is thick and rich
  for their size. Their ears come to an even sharper point than elven ears.

  Windlings mature slowly, reaching adulthood by around age thirty, though their
  general attitude can frequently come across as childlike, even in older
  individuals. The average windling lifespan is roughly 170 years, and they do
  not appear to physi- cally age during their lifetime.

  While their small size and somewhat fragile nature makes them more aware of
  the world’s dangers, windlings love traveling and experiencing new things.
  Indeed, they have a passion and zest for life that few can equal, though their
  curiosity and fascination with new experiences can come across as flighty and
  unfocused.

  Windlings typically live in forested areas, in dwellings made from the local
  environment. Their society is best described as haphazard—members of a clan
  frequently bring back practices and fads they pick up in their travels, so
  there can be little con- sistency from village to village. There are tales of
  windling nobles, but scholars believe this to be no more than a rumor.

  Windlings frequently have a live and let live attitude, but their ability to
  fly gives them a strong love of freedom and as a general rule they abhor
  slavery.

  They are a gregarious and outgoing people, and their love of life is
  frequently expressed through finding the bright side of things. They have a
  reputation among the other races as in- corrigible pranksters, and their
  almost permanent perky and optimistic attitude can come across as grating.

  Perhaps more than any other Namegiver race, windlings are in tune with the
  magic of the world. Almost all windlings can sense the magical world, and
  windling adepts have been known to develop this ability to high degrees."
