description:
  Air. This spell creates a protective cushion of air. The magician exhales
  slowly and makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If
  successful, air rushes in under the target’s clothing, pushing outward to
  create a cushion and providing padding as well as ventilation. The target adds
  +3 Physical Armor and the effects of fatigue are reduced (GM’s discretion). If
  the target is not wearing clothing or armor he receives no benefit—there is
  nothing to constrain the air cushion, so it disperses. This spell is popular
  with elemental fire mining crews working near Death’s Sea.
