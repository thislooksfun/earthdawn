description:
  'This ritual spell "invites" a wandering spirit to live within a circle made
  of bones and transforms them into a bone spirit. The bones of at least one
  animal are used to construct a circle no bigger than the area of effect. The
  magician spends one hour per thread walking the circumference, scratching or
  tracing magical inscriptions and placing bones to form the circle’s outline.
  After completing the circle, he touches the bones and makes a Spellcasting
  test against the spirit’s Mystic Defense. If successful, a bone spirit is
  summoned to live within the circle.

  The spirit is an ally spirit of Strength up to the magician’s Nethermancer
  Circle. It is not very intelligent and has limitations on the powers it can
  possess. The bone spirit’s powers are selected when the bone circle is created
  and may only have the following spirit powers: Aid Summoner, Confusion,
  Durability, Evil Eye, and Manifest. It cannot leave the bone circle, but will
  take physical action against anyone attempting to enter or already in the
  circle.

  Some spells, such as Grave Message (p. 327) and Spirit Portal (p. 341),
  require the use of a bone circle. A magician may have a number of active bone
  circles equal to his Spellcasting Rank.

  Kicking away the bones and erasing the inscriptions is not sufficient to
  destroy a bone circle—it just makes it more difficult to see the circle’s
  outline and therefore avoid disturbing the spirit that dwells there. A bone
  circle can be dispelled, but the magician must touch the circle to do so,
  risking assault from the spirit. The bone spirit will not harm its summoner,
  but cannot otherwise be controlled.'
