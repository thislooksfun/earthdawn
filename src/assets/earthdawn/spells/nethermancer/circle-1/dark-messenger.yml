description:
  This spell commands a nocturnal flying creature to deliver a message.

  It must be cast after sunset and only on a nightflyer already under the
  magician’s control, by being an animal companion or through use of the Command
  Nightflyer talent, p. 135. The message must be short—no more than twice his
  Spellcasting Rank words in length.

  The magician strokes the nightflyer, whispers his message to it, names the
  recipient, and then makes a Spellcasting test against the creature’s Mystic
  Defense.

  If successful, the creature flies off, unerringly seeking out the designated
  recipient and delivering the message in a whispery version of the magician’s
  own voice. If the nightflyer cannot reach the recipient before the spell ends
  or sunrise (whichever comes first), the message is lost.
