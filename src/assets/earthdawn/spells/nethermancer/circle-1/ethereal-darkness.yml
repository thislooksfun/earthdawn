description:
  This spell draws a piece of darkness from another dimension. The magician cups
  his hands together, then touches the target character, object or location,
  commands the darkness to billow forth, and makes a Spellcasting test against
  the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the darkness summoned expands to
  fill a 4-yard radius sphere, centered on the target.

  The darkness extinguishes all light, causing those within the area of effect
  to suffer a Full Darkness penalty to sight-based Action tests. Ordinary light
  does not penetrate Ethereal Darkness. Those with knowledge of Nethermancy are
  unaffected by Ethereal Darkness—they can see normally, as if the spell had
  never been cast.
