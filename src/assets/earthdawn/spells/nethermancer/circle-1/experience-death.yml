description:
  This spell allows a magician to see and experience a character’s dying
  moments. By doing this, the magician touches the spirit world to recreate the
  events of the character’s death. The magician closes his eyes, then points his
  palms out toward the corpse and makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s
  Mystic Defense (as if he were still alive). If successful, the last few rounds
  of the target’s life are played out to the magician, ending with the target’s
  death.

  The magician must enter into a trance, concentrating to maintain the spell.
  While in this state, he senses everything from the point of view of the
  deceased. Unfortunately, this also includes taking any damage the deceased
  suffered before he died.

  The Effect test gives the magician temporary Damage Points. Any damage
  inflicted on the magician first reduces his temporary Damage Points before
  being added to his Current Damage (Mystic Armor provides protection). The
  magician cannot take Wounds from the effects of this spell. If his Current
  Damage equals or exceeds his Unconsciousness or Death Rating, he still passes
  out or dies, however.
