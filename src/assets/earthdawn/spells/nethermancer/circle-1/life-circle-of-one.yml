description:
  This spell creates a magical circle to repel undead, Horrors, or Horror
  constructs. The magician spits into his hand, then outlines a 4-yard radius
  circle with his fingers and makes a Spellcasting (6) test. If successful, the
  circle resists any undead, Horror, or Horror construct attempting to enter.
  The magician makes a Spellcasting test against the entityâ€™s Mystic Defense.

  If successful, the circle repels and harms the entity. The Effect test
  determines how much damage is inflicted on the entity.

  The spell can only repel a single entity each round. Multiple enemies can
  easily swamp the circle if they surround it. Should more than one entity
  enter, the circle will attempt to repel the being with the highest Mystic
  Defense. Given sufficient preparation time, a magician may cast multiple life
  circles inside each other, creating concentric circles to protect those
  standing in the innermost one and affording some protection from multiple
  entities for a few minutes.
