description:
  This spell allows a character to become virtually invisible in the shadows.
  The magician makes a Spellcasting Test against the target’s Mystic Defense.

  If successful, the target gains a +4 bonus to all Stealthy Stride tests while
  near shadows for the duration of the spell and may use Stealthy Stride as a
  default skill if they do not possess it. Though the target can still be seen
  normally in light, the presence of light does not end the spell—the target
  becomes near-invisible again by simply stepping back into a shadow.
