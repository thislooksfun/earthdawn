description:
  This spell enhances a character’s Mystic Armor. The magician draws jagged blue
  sigils of protection in the air and makes a Spellcasting test against the
  target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, a glimmering suit of blue chain mail
  appears, momentarily covering the target before it sinks into his body. The
  target adds +3 to his Mystic Armor.
