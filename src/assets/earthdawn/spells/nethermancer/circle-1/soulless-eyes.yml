description:
  This spell enhances the ability to intimidate others. Traditionally it gives
  the target’s eyes a cruel cast that makes viewers have no doubt about what
  they are willing to do, though it manifests in different fashions for some
  magicians. The magician glares and smiles cruelly, then places his hand on the
  target and makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If
  successful, the target gains a +3 bonus to any Intimidation tests made for the
  duration of the spell.
