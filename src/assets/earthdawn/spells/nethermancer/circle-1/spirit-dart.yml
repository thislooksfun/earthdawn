description:
  This spell attacks a character with a small dart shaped from astral energy.
  The magician pinches himself and flicks his wrist as if throwing a dart, then
  makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful,
  the Effect test determines how much damage is inflicted. After damage is
  inflicted, the target’s Mystic Armor is reduced by 2 until the end of the next
  round.
