description:
  This spell draws on the malevolent energy of the spirits of the dead to harm
  others. The magician touches his victim and makes a Spellcasting test against
  the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the Effect test determines how
  much damage is inflicted and the target’s Defenses (Mystic and Physical) are
  reduced by 2 until the end of the next round.
