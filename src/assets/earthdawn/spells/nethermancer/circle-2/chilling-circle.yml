description:
  Waterâ€“Cold. This spell creates a circle of icy mist. The magician spins round
  in a circle, then suddenly stops to kneel, touches the ground and makes a
  Spellcasting test against the highest Mystic Defense of all characters inside
  the area of effect. If successful, an eerie rune unique to the magician
  appears on the ground and a cloud of freezing mist rises from the glowing
  shape. All characters, except the caster, take Nethermancer Circle +4 damage
  each round and their Movement Rate is halved while they are in the circle.
