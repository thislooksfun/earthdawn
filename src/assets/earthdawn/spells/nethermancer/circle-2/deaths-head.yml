description:
  This spell transforms the magician’s head into a gore-spattered skull,
  terrifying those whom he sets his gaze on. The magician touches his face and
  makes a Spellcasting test against his Mystic Defense. If successful, he may
  use the Frighten talent as a Simple action for the duration of the spell.
