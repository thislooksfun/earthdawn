description:
  Water–Cold. This spell coats a weapon with a layer of inky frost pulled
  directly from astral space. The magician exhales into his clenched fist and
  makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful,
  shadowy tendrils of freezing fog swirl out of his fist and envelop the weapon.
  The wielder adds a D4 Bonus Die to the weapon’s Damage test and any target
  that takes damage from the weapon suffers a -2 penalty to their Mystic Defense
  until the end of the next round. The spell can be cast on weapons made from
  any material—wood, metal, bone, and so on.
