description:
  This spell allows the magician to hear anything a target speaks near a shadow.
  The magician makes a Spellcasting test against the target’s Mystical Defense.
  If successful, the magician hears any sound the target makes while he is
  within 2 yards of any shadow, including the target’s own. The target may make
  a Perception test against the Spellcasting test.

  If successful, he detects that he is somehow being observed.
