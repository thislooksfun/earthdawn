description:
  This spell creates a shield of mist that hardens and moves to deflect blows
  directed against the magician. The magician moves his hands over his body
  while wisps of mist pour from his fingertips and then makes a Spellcasting
  test against his Mystic Defense. If successful, he gains a +4 bonus to Avoid
  Blow tests (p. 129) against close and ranged combat Attack tests directed at
  him. If the Avoid Blow test succeeds, the mist deflects the blow and the
  magician suffers no harm. The magician is visible within the mist and can
  easily see out. The mist does not hinder his actions.
