description:
  Summoning. This spell coalesces fog from the surrounding air and coaxes a
  maleficent spirit to inhabit it. The magician blows openly into the air and
  makes a Spellcasting test against the spirit’s Mystic Defense (see below); the
  magician may choose a lower effective Circle for the spell effect. If
  successful, the fog ghost appears where the magician wishes within the spell’s
  range, whereupon it immediately attacks the nearest character (even the
  magician himself). Each round, the fog ghost indiscriminately attacks whoever
  is nearest to it using the Effect Step for Attack and Damage tests until it is
  destroyed or the spell ends.

  The fog is nearly impervious to physical attacks but the astral pattern
  containing the spirit can be disrupted by any attack which targets the fog
  ghost’s Mystic Defense (Nethermancer Circle+5) or Physical Defense
  (Nethermancer Circle+15). To successfully disrupt the pattern, a character
  must inflict damage in a single attack equal to or greater than the Effect
  Step. Destroying the fog does not harm the spirit, which simply returns to its
  netherworld and waits for another chance to harm the living.

  A fog ghost will not attack undead or other spirits. The spell cannot be cast
  in desert or other very dry environments, nor can it be cast when the
  temperature is below freezing. This spell may only have one active casting at
  a time (including Aspect of the Fog Ghost).

  This spell may be stored in the same spell matrix as Aspect of the Fog Ghost.
