name: Acrobatic Defense
attr: dex
action: simple
strain: 1
skill_use: novice
description:
  The adept flips, spins, somersaults, or performs similar acrobatic maneuvers,
  making him harder to hit. He must be able to move and have sufficient space to
  maneuver in. The adept makes an Acrobatic Defense test against the highest
  Physical Defense of any opponents in close combat range (2 yards). The adept
  adds +2 to his Physical Defense for each success scored for the remainder of
  the round. If the adept is knocked down or otherwise finds his movement
  restricted, he loses this bonus.

  Acrobatic Defense cannot be used in the same round as Anticipate Blow.
