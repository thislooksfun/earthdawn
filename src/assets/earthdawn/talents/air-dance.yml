description:
  The adept floats on a thin cushion of air, allowing him to perform quick,
  gliding movements and rapid attacks. Air Dance requires that the adept be able
  to move. Windlings may use this talent while flying, but it cannot be combined
  with other talents that use forms of magical flight, such as Gliding Stride.

  The adept substitutes his Air Dance Step for his Dexterity Step when making
  his Initiative test (see Determine Initiative, p. 372), suffering Initiative
  penalties for armor as normal. If making a close combat attack that round, the
  adept compares his Initiative test result against his opponent’s. If he scores
  three successes, the adept may make an additional close combat attack after
  his opponent’s action. This talent does not allow an adept to remain suspended
  in midair, or do anything to reduce falling damage.
