description:
  "The adept knows how to work the rigging, tiller, and oars of airships. The
  adept makes an Air Sailing (5) test to help propel an airship. If successful,
  he counts as one crew member for each success scored.

  An adept who wishes to join an airship crew must know Air Sailing at Rank 1 or
  higher. Positions of command require greater ability: the higher an adept’s
  Air Sailing Rank, the bigger the ship he can command or the higher the
  position he can fill within a ship’s crew. For an airship to stay airborne, at
  least 25 percent of the required crew must make successful Air Sailing tests
  each hour. For example, an airship with a crew of twenty needs at least five
  rowers to succeed to stay afloat. This might be an equivalent number, such as
  two rowers, one of whom achieved four successes on his test. If at least 50
  percent of the crew make successful tests, the airship can maneuver at its
  current altitude, dive, or climb slowly in a straight line. If 75 percent of
  the crew are successful, the airship can speed up, maneuver while climbing, or
  perform aerobatics."
