description:
  The adept communicates without vocalizing, moving his lips and mouthing the
  words he wants to speak. He makes an Air Speaking test and compares it to the
  Mystic Defense of each target he wishes to speak with. If successful, the
  target hears the adept speaking as if he were conversing normally, regardless
  of other noise in the area. If unsuccessful, the individual target does not
  hear the adept. There is no limit to the number of targets that can be
  affected at once, but all must be within Rank x10 yards, and all targets hear
  the same words. The adept must speak in a language he knows. If a target does
  not speak the language, they cannot understand what it being said.
