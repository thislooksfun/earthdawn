description:
  An animal companion’s ability to take damage is improved in a similar manner
  to the Durability ability (p. 85), with each rank increasing the companion’s
  Health Ratings by +5. The maximum number of animal companions that can benefit
  from this talent is equal to the adept’s Animal Companion Durability rank. An
  animal companion may only benefit from a single Durability-type talent at a
  time.
