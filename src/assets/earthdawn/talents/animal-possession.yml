description:
  The adept places his spirit into the body of an animal by touching it and
  making an Animal Possession test against the animal’s Mystic Defense. If
  successful, his spirit takes possession of the animal’s body. The adept
  controls the animal’s body for a number of hours equal to his Animal
  Possession rank or until animal and adept touch again. While using this
  talent, the adept’s physical form slumps into a coma-like state. He retains
  his own intellect while in the animal’s body, but cannot perform any actions
  that the animal is normally incapable of, such as speaking.

  An unwilling animal may attempt to resist the talent at the time of possession
  by making a Willpower test against the adept’s Animal Possession Step. If
  successful, the animal prevents the possession occurring, although the adept
  can try again. Otherwise the talent functions normally and the animal may take
  no further independent actions until the possession ends. When the talent ends
  the adept’s spirit returns to his proper body. If the host animal is killed or
  knocked unconscious while the talent is in effect, the possession ends
  immediately, and the adept suffers any damage dealt to the host while the
  possession was in effect. No armor protects from this damage.
