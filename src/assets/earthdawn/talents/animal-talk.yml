description:
  The adept can understand animals and creatures, talking with them by imitating
  their own forms of communication and making an Animal Talk test against the
  target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the adept can talk to and understand
  the target for a number of minutes equal to his Animal Talk rank. This talent
  does not compel the animal or creature to communicate with the adept, it
  merely makes communication possible.

  The gamemaster is advised to treat animals as if they were gamemaster
  characters, using the rules for Social Interactions (see the Gamemaster’s
  Guide), but he should keep in mind that animals aren’t as intelligent as
  Namegivers and perceive the world differently.
