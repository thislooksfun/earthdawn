examples:
  - Mica has Anticipate Blow at Rank 5, and rolls two successes on his test. He
    gains a +4 bonus to his Physical Defense against attacks from that opponent
    this round. When he attacks that target with his Melee Weapons talent, he
    adds +4 Steps. He also uses his Second Weapon talent, but does not receive a
    bonus to that test, since Anticipate Blow only adds a bonus to the first
    Attack test.
description:
  The adept anticipates attacks made against him, making him harder to hit. The
  adept must have a higher Initiative result than his target, and makes an
  Anticipate Blow test against the target’s Mystic Defense. Each success adds +2
  to his Physical Defense against the target’s attacks until the end of the
  round. The adept can use this talent a number of times equal to his Anticipate
  Blow rank each round, taking the strain for each new target.

  After a successful Anticipate Blow test, the adept also adds +2 per success as
  a bonus to the first Attack test they make against that target. Anticipate
  Blow does not convey any additional attacks—the adept must use other talents
  or skills to attack as normal.
