skill_use: novice
description:
  The adept confuses others by muttering dire, largely incomprehensible,
  warnings and making an Arcane Mutterings test against the highest Social
  Defense among the target group, +1 for each additional character. If
  successful, the target characters become confused and are considered Harried
  for a number of rounds equal to the adept’s Arcane Mutterings rank. Due to the
  disconcerting nature of the talent, this penalty also applies to the target’s
  Social Defense. During this time, the adept must continually “mutter” or the
  effect ends; this requires his concentration. If the adept achieves extra
  successes, those affected by the talent will take no hostile actions against
  the adept or his obvious companions—so long as no one takes any hostile action
  against them. Arcane Mutterings is ineffective against targets already engaged
  in combat.
