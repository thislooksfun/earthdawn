description:
  The adept increases the local astral background interference to make
  spellcasting more difficult. He makes an Astral Interference test against the
  highest Mystic Defense within Rank x4 yards. If successful, a shimmering wave
  emanates from the adept to cover the area. All Spellcasting tests made inside
  the area, or that target someone in the area, suffer a -2 penalty per success
  for Rank rounds. This penalty also affects astral sensing tests (p. 209).
