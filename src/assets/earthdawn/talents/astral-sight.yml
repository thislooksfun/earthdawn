description:
  The adept sees into the astral plane, and is able to view the astral patterns
  and imprints. He makes an Astral Sight test against a base Difficulty Number
  of 6, modified by the local conditions of astral space. If successful, he can
  see the astral imprints, magical auras, and patterns of any target with a
  Mystic Defense equal to or lower than the test result.

  Each use of the talent lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Astral Sight
  rank, and the adept can only see astral impressions that are within his Astral
  Sight rank x10 yards.

  More information on perceiving astral space and the Difficulty Numbers
  associated with it are explained in the Workings of Magic chapter (see Using
  Astral Sensing, p. 209). Examining magical items using Astral Sight does not
  provide any information about the itemâ€™s history or reveal any Key Knowledges
  (p. 221).
