description:
  The adept avoids injury by dodging or parrying blows directed against him.
  When attacked in close or ranged combat, the adept may make an Avoid Blow test
  against his opponent’s Attack test result. If successful, the adept avoids the
  blow—he sees the attack coming and dodges or parries it at the last moment.
  The adept can avoid a maximum number of attacks equal to his Avoid Blow rank
  each round, but only one attempt per Attack test. An adept cannot use Avoid
  Blow if he is blindsided or surprised by his attacker.
