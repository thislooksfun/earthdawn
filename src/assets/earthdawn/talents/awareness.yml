description:
  The adept has trained to be more aware of his surroundings, noticing things
  that he might otherwise miss. When trying to spot someone or
  something—including hidden vaults, secret doors, or disguised or concealed
  characters—the adept makes an Awareness test instead of a Perception test. If
  successful, he notices the target of his search if it is within short range of
  Visibility (see the Gamemaster’s Guide).

  With three or more successes, he notices the target within medium range of
  Visibility. If the adept possess the Disarm Trap talent or skill, he may use
  this to find traps and wards.
