description:
  The adept can converse with and command nocturnal, flying creatures, such as
  owls, bats, and krilworms. A successful Command Nightflyer test against the
  target’s Mystic Defense allows the adept to converse with the creature in
  their “tongue” for Rank minutes. He may also give it simple commands equal to
  the number of successes that will be obeyed during this time. The commands
  will still be followed even if the talent has ended, but the adept needs to
  use the talent again if the result of the action will require another
  conversation. The creature’s survival instincts cannot be overridden, nor can
  it be ordered to behave against its basic nature. For example, a bat could not
  be forced to scout around during daylight hours when it would normally be
  resting.
