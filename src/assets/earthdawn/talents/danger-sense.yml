description:
  The adept develops a supernatural awareness of danger, allowing him to react
  more quickly in hazardous situations. This talent may be used when the adept
  might be Surprised, or when he is trying to avoid a trap or other danger. He
  makes a Danger Sense test against the Initiative test result of the trap or
  hazard. If successful, he may act normally, possibly avoiding harm. If being
  ambushed or otherwise surprised by an attack, the adept avoids the penalty for
  being surprised if the result of his Danger Sense test is higher than the
  Initiative result of the attacker. This talent only detects hazards or threats
  within Danger Sense rank x10 yards.
