description:
  The adept stops any ongoing magical effect that is the result of a spell or
  talent. The adept must be within Rank x2 yards of the target effect, and makes
  a Dispel Magic test against a Difficulty Number based on the power of the
  effect (see Dispelling Magic, p. 265). If successful, the spell or talent ends
  immediately. This talent has no effect on creature or Horror powers that are
  not spells.
