description:
  The adept diverts an opponent’s attention by making himself a more tempting
  target. He makes a Distract test against the target’s Social Defense. For each
  success, the adept suffers a -1 penalty to his Physical Defense against
  attacks by his target, but the target is distracted, suffering the same
  penalty to his Physical Defense against attacks from other characters. The
  target is considered Blindsided (see p. 386) for the rest of the round. The
  normal Physical Defense penalty for being Blindsided is replaced with the
  penalty from this talent, but restrictions still apply—such as being unable to
  use active defenses.
