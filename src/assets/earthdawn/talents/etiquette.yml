description:
  Etiquette is the art of proper behavior in social situations and can be
  extremely important—improper behavior may be punished by responses ranging
  from the scorn of nobles to beheading at the hands of enraged ork scorchers.
  The adept observes the surrounding culture for a minute, then makes an
  Etiquette test against the Difficulty Number of knowing the proper behavior
  for a given social situation. The base Difficulty Number is 5, with the
  gamemaster modifying the target depending on how unfamiliar the adept is with
  that culture. The Difficulty Number is typically increased by +3 for each
  differing aspect. Typical sources for modification include different social
  standing, different race, a foreign land with different customs, and so on.

  If successful, the number of successes alters the reaction of observers. A
  single success means observers believe the adept possesses the rudiments of
  proper behavior; two successes means those same people approve of the adept’s
  manners; three or more successes so impresses observers with the adept’s
  manners that their Attitude toward him improves by one degree (to a maximum of
  Friendly). The effect lasts for a number of days equal to the adept’s
  Etiquette rank or until the social situation ends, whichever comes first.
