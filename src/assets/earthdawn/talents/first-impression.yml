description:
  The adept favorably impresses a gamemaster character he has met by making a
  First Impression test against the target’s Social Defense. If successful, the
  target’s Attitude improves toward the adept by one degree (a Neutral character
  becomes Friendly; an Unfriendly character becomes Neutral; and so on). With
  three or more successes, it improves by two degrees. The new Attitude may be
  changed for better or worse through future interactions, but reverts back to
  the original level at a rate of one degree per day. Any hostile act the adept
  commits against the target immediately erases the impression.

  The adept may not use this talent again on a given target until the effects of
  a prior use have faded. More information on Attitudes can be found in the
  Gamemaster’s Guide.
