  - Relayn is a Novice Weaponsmith with Rank 3 in Forge Weapon. While her master
    has been called away on business, a Warrior comes into the shop looking to
    have the enhancement on his axe renewed. The axe has been forged with a +5
    bonus. Relayn can renew the enhancement with her own Forge Weapon talent,
    but the axe will be reduced to only having a +3 bonus—Relayn’s rank in Forge
    Weapon.

description:
  The adept performs a ritual to magically improve the Damage Step of a weapon,
  including melee, missile, and thrown weapons, but not ammunition, like arrows
  or bolts. The work must be carried out at a properly equipped forge or
  workshop. The ritual requires eight hours a day for seven consecutive days,
  after which the adept makes a Forge Weapon test against a Difficulty Number 6+
  the number of forge enhancements the item currently has.
  
  For each success the weapon’s Damage Step is increased by +1. This talent can
  be used on mundane or magical weapons.
  
  The adept cannot forge a weapon’s bonus higher than his Forge Weapon rank. For
  example, an adept with Forge Weapon at Rank 4 can perform increases up to +4,
  regardless of whether he forged the previous increases himself.
  
  Damage Step increases last for a year and a day from the date of the last
  successful forging. Additional Forge Weapon tests can be made at any time to
  extend the duration, but any bonuses beyond those allowed by the smith’s rank
  in Forge Weapon are lost.
  
  The services of smiths can be bought in larger cities, but the more skilled
  the smith, the higher the cost. The typical cost is 50 silver times the
  smith’s rank in Forge Weapon per attempt. It is typical for half the fee to be
  paid up front, with the rest paid on delivery after successful use of the
  talent.
