description:
  The adept scares a target by staring silently into the character’s eyes and
  making a Frighten test against the target’s Mystic Defense. If successful, the
  target becomes frightened and suffers a −2 penalty to all tests for each
  success generated by the adept. The target remains scared for a number of
  rounds equal to the adept’s Frighten rank. Each round, the target may make a
  Willpower test against the adept’s Frighten Step. If successful, he throws off
  the effect of his fear and the talent ends.

  Targets that are immune to fear cannot be affected by this talent.
