description:
  The adept impresses a character with a display of skill of his choice. The
  display can be of any kind, as long as the target character observes it. Most
  adepts will use a display that fits their style—an Archer, for example, will
  perform a called shot with his bow, while a Troubadour will play a stirring
  epic, and a Swordmaster might cut the buttons off an opponent’s coat. The
  adept activates this talent, and then uses the appropriate talent or skill for
  his chosen display. Instead of its normal use, the test result is compared to
  the target’s Social Defense.

  If successful, the target becomes favorably impressed and the adept adds +2
  per success to any Interaction tests he makes against that character for a
  number of hours equal to his Impressive Display rank. Combat talents used in
  conjunction with this talent cannot deal damage. The maximum number of
  successes that will count as a bonus is the adept’s Impressive Display rank.
