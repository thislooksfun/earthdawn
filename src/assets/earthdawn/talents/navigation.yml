description:
  The adept can read maps, chart courses, and travel safely, minimizing
  environmental challenges and other hazards. To pinpoint their location,
  navigators must be able to see the sky and possess a set of navigator’s
  charts. Navigation often relies on the movement of the sun, the
  constellations, and similar astronomical phenomena for direction.
  Consequently, navigation is most effective on clear nights when the stars
  shine brightest. The adept spends ten minutes determining his current position
  and makes a Navigation test against a Difficulty Number determined by the
  gamemaster, based on the Navigation Table, and modified depending on the
  circumstances. Incomplete or inaccurate charts can increase the Difficulty
  Number by +1 to +5.

  The test result determines the adept’s accuracy. A single success gives a
  position accurate to within 10 miles; two successes within 5 miles; three
  successes, within 2 miles; four or more successes places the navigator within
  a mile of his target location. If the test fails, the adept inadvertently
  plots a destination 20 to 25 miles wide of his intended destination. He only
  recognizes his mistake if a subsequent Navigation test yields a better result,
  or he arrives at the destination and realizes that it’s not the place he
  intended to travel to.

  A Rule of One Result positions the adept more than 25 miles away from the
  intended destination—he is completely lost, but will be adamant that he knows
  exactly where he is. Any further Navigation tests the adept makes add +2 to
  the Difficulty Number (assuming his friends can convince him to make another
  test).
