description:
  The adept summons a spy spirit to serve as a lookout by making an Orbiting Spy
  (6) test. If successful, the spirit travels in a circular pattern around the
  adept, up to 20 yards distance, for one hour per success.

  Conjured spy spirits cannot affect or be affected by the physical world and
  are immune to most spells, except those which disrupt or dispel magic. An
  adept can only have one orbiting spy active at a time.

  Whenever the adept wants to use the spirit to detect something, he makes an
  Orbiting Spy test instead of a Perception test. If successful, the spy spirit
  informs him of anything unusual it notices. The spirit can be given specific
  instructions on what to look for, to prevent unpleasant surprises; the maximum
  number of instructions is equal to his Orbiting Spy rank. The spirit will
  remain on alert for these creatures or objects and will notify the adept if
  they are detected—the gamemaster makes Orbiting Spy tests for the spirit and
  advises the adept of the results, if applicable.

  Spy spirits can see into the astral plane as well as the physical world—though
  this follows the normal rules for astral sensing (p. 209)—so they can inform
  the adept of anything lurking around in astral space.
