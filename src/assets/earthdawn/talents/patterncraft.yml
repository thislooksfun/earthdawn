description:
  The adept gains a greater understanding of the mysteries and applications of
  magic. This includes the ability to read and write magical writing, such as
  that found in grimoires or magical glyphs. For each page that he is attempting
  to translate, the adept makes a Patterncraft test against the writing’s
  Difficulty Number, determined by the gamemaster. If successful, the success
  level determines how well he understands the content.

  A single success allows the adept to understand the basic gist of the text,
  but not any subtle or complex ideas it contains; two or three successes means
  he understands the subtleties of the text, though he might misinterpret
  obscure clues or riddles; four or more successes means the adept completely
  understands content, easily deciphering any hints, clues, or hidden meanings.

  This talent also allows magicians to learn new spells. A magician can attempt
  to learn a spell by making a Patterncraft test against the spell’s Learning
  Difficulty. If successful, he has learned the spell and can write it in his
  grimoire. The magician can learn only one spell per day. He may learn more
  spells by sacrificing Recovery tests— for each Recovery test sacrificed, the
  magician may make an additional Patterncraft test. See Learning New Spells, p.
  452, for more information on learning and scribing spells.

  Other functions of this talent include identifying spells (Difficulty equal to
  the Dispel Difficulty, with a +4 bonus if it is from the adept’s discipline),
  designing new common magical items and thread items, and creating signature
  spells.
