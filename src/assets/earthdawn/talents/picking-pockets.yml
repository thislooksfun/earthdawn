description:
  "The adept combines a deft touch with minor levitation magic to remove an item
  from the pocket or pouch of another character. The adept makes a Picking
  Pockets test, the result being the Difficulty Number for attempts made to
  notice the theft.

  Anyone able to observe the adeptâ€™s action, including the target character, may
  make a Perception test to notice the action immediately after the act has
  occurred.

  Skill Use: The non-magical version of this skill does not include the
  levitation magic, but is otherwise identical."
