  - At the Great Library of Throal, Tomas is looking for information on Cardael,
    a ruined tower now rumored to be the base of a cult his group is pursuing.
    Based on the nature of the information being sought, the gamemaster decides
    the Difficulty Number for the Research test is 7.

    Tomas rolls a 19—three successes! Tomas had been searching for the tower’s
    general location, but the gamemaster decides that the high result earns a
    bonus—Tomas learns not only the tower’s general location, but also that the
    tower was built and used as a retreat for a Nethermancer, who had some
    experience with the Horror the cult worships.

description:
  The adept finds information through study and investigation, including library
  research and following up on rumors and legends. He makes a Research test
  against a Difficulty Number determined by the type of information sought. The
  gamemaster may use the numbers suggested in the Research Table, or the
  guidelines for creating Difficulty Numbers in the Gamemaster’s Guide. The
  success level determines how much information is obtained. More successes
  often turns up more detailed information than the adept initially sought.
