examples:
  - Mica, a dwarf Swordmaster, is in melee combat with an ork scorcher. The ork
    attacks and scores a 13 on his Attack test. Mica uses Riposte, and rolls a
    21 on his Riposte test—two successes. He successfully parries the ork’s
    attack and counterattacks.

    The ork’s Physical Defense is 9. Mica’s attack hits, scoring two extra
    successes. But only one counts for the purposes of bonus damage.

description:
  The adept uses his melee weapon to block an opponent’s melee attack, possibly
  turning it back on his attacker. He makes a Riposte test against his
  opponent’s Attack test result. If successful, the adept parries or blocks the
  attack and avoids any damage.

  If the Riposte test scores any extra successes, the adept counterattacks using
  the Riposte test as an Attack test. The Riposte test result is compared to the
  target’s Physical Defense. If successful, the adept makes a Damage test, but
  reduces the number of successes by one for the purposes of bonus damage.

  The adept can only riposte attacks that he is aware of. If he is blindsided or
  surprised, he cannot use this talent. The adept can use this talent a number
  of times each round equal to his Riposte rank, but may only make a single
  counterattack per round. Riposte tests can only be made against melee attacks
  directed against the adept. An adept may not use Riposte and another talent
  that negates being hit, such as Avoid Blow, against the same attack.

optional_rule:
  name: Riposting Longer Weapons
  description:
    When using Riposte against longer melee weapons, the adept may not be able
    to reach his opponent to make an effective counterattack. He must have a
    higher Initiative than his opponent or be wielding a weapon with a Size no
    smaller than his opponent’s weapon Size–2, to be able to inflict a return
    attack and therefore damage him. For example, a counterattack to an attack
    from a lance (Size 6) may be made with a successful two-handed sword (Size
    5), but not with a broadsword (Size 3). The Riposte test is made as normal
    against long weapons and can deflect such attacks, thus avoiding harm, but
    the adept cannot inflict a return blow if his weapon is not large enough.
