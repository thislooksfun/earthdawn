description:
  "The adept magically learns to communicate with others in different languages.
  Using this talent he can learn a number of languages equal to his Speak
  Language rank. If he has not reached this maximum, the adept can attempt to
  learn a new language by listening to a fluent speaker for at least one minute,
  then making a Speak Language test against the language’s Learning Difficulty.
  If successful, he learns the language and notes it on his Character Record
  Sheet. If the test fails, the adept cannot attempt to learn that specific
  language again until he improves his Speak Language rank.

  The Learning Difficulty for the different racial languages is shown in the
  Language Table. The numbers reflect the difficulty of learning the base
  “racial” versions of these languages. Dialects are considered different
  languages for the purposes of this talent (see below).

  When speaking a language learned through this talent, the adept makes a Speak
  Language test against the Learning Difficulty of the language. The success
  level determines how well they communicate.

  Simple sentences or ideas, such as “Which way to the sheriff?” may only
  require a single success; normal conversation that includes idioms or jargon
  require two; technical conversations or other discussions filled with
  specialized jargon require three successes; conversations about philosophy, or
  other abstract ideas, may require four or more. Partial successes may convey
  more or less detail at the gamemaster’s discretion.

  The effect of each test lasts for a number of hours equal to the adept’s Speak
  Language rank, allowing communication at the level achieved by the test
  result.

  If the adept requires more complex conversation, he must make another Speak
  Language test. The Strain cost reflects the concentration required to
  establish and maintain communication.

  Dialects:
  Languages are often complex and most possess many different variations, called
  dialects. These dialects are sometimes regional, others by city, or even by
  kaer. The Learning Difficulty of a dialect is based on the original language,
  usually the base DN +2, but higher difficulties are possible. The adept must
  know how to speak the base language before he can attempt to learn a dialect
  of that language. If the adept knows the base language of a dialect, he can
  communicate, but his ability to do so may be limited at the gamemaster’s
  discretion.

  There is a non-magical version of this talent, but it is different enough that
  it is covered in more depth in the Skills chapter, p. 182.
