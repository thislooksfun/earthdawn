description:
  A Standard Matrix is the most basic spell matrix, an astral construct that
  allows magicians to cast spells without interference from the residents of
  astral space. A magician may only safely cast a spell after he has first
  placed it in a spell matrix. The rank determines the maximum spell circle that
  the matrix can hold.

  For example, a Rank 2 Standard Matrix can hold a single First or Second Circle
  spell. Each matrix represents a separate talent with its own Rank, and is
  improved independently. For more information on Spell Matrices and how they
  are used, see the Spell Magic chapter, p. 246.
