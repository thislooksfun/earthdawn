description:
  "The adept combines fluid movement with magical effects that dampen sound and
  mask his presence, including deepening shadows and using illusion to remain
  unobserved. The adept makes a Stealthy Stride test, the result being the
  Difficulty Number for any Perception tests made to notice the adept.

  This talent does not allow the adept to vanish while being observed—once a
  character is aware of the adept’s presence and watching him the talent will
  not work. Using Stealthy Stride halves the adept’s Movement Rate and the
  effect of any abilities used to increase movement speed.

  Skill Use: The non-magical version of this talent does not include the magical
  effects, but otherwise works the same way as the talent."
