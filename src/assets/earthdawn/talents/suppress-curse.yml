attr: wil
action: standard
strain: 1
skill_use: no
description:
  The adept temporarily nullifies any curses or negative magical effects
  affecting a target. The adept makes a Suppress Curse test against the highest
  Step Number or Dispel Difficulty (p.265) of any negative effects on the
  target, +1 for each additional effect. If successful, all of the effects are
  neutralized for a number of rounds equal to the adept’s Suppress Curse rank.

  The duration of any negative effects continue as normal; if their duration
  ends while Suppress Curse is in effect, they do not resume when the talent
  expires. The adept must remain within his Suppress Curse rank in yards of the
  target throughout the talent’s duration, or the effect ends.
