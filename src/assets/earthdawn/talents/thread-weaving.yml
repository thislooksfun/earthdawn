description:
  "The adept creates and manipulates magical threads. He can have a maximum
  number of permanent threads active equal to his Thread Weaving rank. Each
  individual thread can be woven to a maximum Thread Rank equal to the adept’s
  Thread Weaving rank.

  This limit does not apply to threads woven for spell patterns; such threads
  are temporary, lasting only long enough for the spell to be cast. See the
  Workings of Magic (p. 202) and Spell Magic (p. 246) chapters for more
  information about threads and spell patterns.

  Each Discipline has its own unique variant of the Thread Weaving talent, shown
  in parentheses in the Discipline’s talent progression. If a rule calls for
  this specific name, the Thread Weaving talent from that specific Discipline
  must be used, not just any Thread Weaving talent. Ad- epts with more than one
  Discipline learn and improve each of their Discipline’s Thread Weaving talents
  independently. See Learning New Disciplines, p. 455, for more information on
  multi-Disciplining and the Thread Weaving talent.
