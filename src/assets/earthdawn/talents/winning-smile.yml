description:
  The adept appears more attractive to another person. The adept makes a
  Winning Smile test against the target’s Social Defense. If successful, the
  target finds his appearance very pleasing. The adept adds +2 per success to
  any Interaction tests he makes against the target for a number of hours equal
  to his Winning Smile rank. An adept may attempt a Winning Smile test only once
  against a given character each day.

  While most effective against members of the same race, the adept can use this
  talent on characters of other races, though typically with greater difficulty.
  The gamemaster should determine whether such an attempt requires a higher
  success level to be effective and, if so, how much higher.

  For example, a human trying to impress a dwarf may require two successes on
  his Winning Smile test. That same human attempting to impress a t’skrang might
  need three successes, while an attempt to win over a dragon would require four
  or more (if it is even possible). By contrast, if the target in question had a
  preference for humans, the test might require only a single success.
